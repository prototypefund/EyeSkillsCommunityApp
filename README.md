## What is this?

"Eye Skills, You Skills, We all got Skills for ..."

Basic questions remain unanswered about what Lazy Eye really is, and how able different people are to overcome or moderate its effects. 

It is our mission to empower the Lazy Eye community to collectively contribute to answering these questions.

Take a look at [EyeSkills.org](www.eyeskills.org) for more info!

The community app is full of experimental code.  "Done is better than good".  

It is fine to create exploratory scenes which are quick and dirty.  Scenes that prove themselves valuable and robust can then be moved into the framework.

## What will I need to make this work?
