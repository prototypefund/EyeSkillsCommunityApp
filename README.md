## What is this?

"Eye Skills, You Skills, We all got Skills for ..."

Itâ€™s time for the Lazy Eye community to empower and help itself.  Basic questions remain unanswered about what Lazy Eye really is, how it works, and how able different people are to overcome or moderate its effects.

For the last years this project has been funded privately, and with the support of the prototypefund.de. We have done this because my wife and I decided it mattered, and we could help make a difference. It has now outgrown us, and our resources. Only some kind of win-win situation will lead to permanent, ongoing efforts and continual development.  

I believe that EyeSkills has three missions. The first is to empower and support the amateur and professional research community to discover answers to these questions. This is not a question of commerce. This is a question of freedom and self-determination.  

This EyeSkills Community Development is designed to ease the development of apps related to the visual system. In particular, we are interested in Amblyopia and Strabismus.

In addition to the core framework, it includes some example scenarios showing how it can be used.
